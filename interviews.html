            <b>What are your responsibilities relative to Hog Island Oysters?</b>
        <br><ins>Interview 1:</ins> Executive chef, Hog Island Oyster Bar Napa.
        
	<br><ins>Interview 2:</ins> Sous Chef and lead for seafood sourcing at Hog Island's Oyster Bar in San Francisco.
	<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins> Assistant Retail Manager at the Farm in Marshall Ca. Responsibilities include Customer Service, Hosting, Bartending, Shucking, Retail Sales, Tour Docent, Oyster Sale Projections and a few other hats that relate to Oyster Farming.
        <br>
        <br>
<b>How does Hog Island Oysters play a role in the Bay Area food system?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> We cultivate 5 species of oysters, including the native Olympia oyster, clams and mussels. We have set the standard for quality and sustainable practices.
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> The farming production of our oysters cleanse and enrich our local watershed, providing essential habitat to many other creatures, often themselves important participants in our food chain.
<br><ins>Response 3:</ins> HIOC is a major part of the Bay Area Food System because we offer a Sustainable & Environmentally Friendly Locally Grown Food alternative to Mass produced and heavily marketed Corporate Food Choices that bombard consumers every waking hour of their lives. i.e.- Fast Food Commercials, Frozen Dinners, Microwaveable Food...
<br>
        <br>
<b>What are the most high demand or most frequently purchased fish?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> Most frequent- local rockfish and squid.
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> Over the last six months, we have probably focused a lot on California Halibut, King Salmon, White Seabass, Lingcod, Black Cod and Dungeness Crab.
<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins>Oysters of course - HIOC Sweetwater's by volume.
<br>
        <br>
<b>How are your practices/the fish you carry sustainable?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> We try to purchase only from reputable vendors who acknowledge that there is a better way to do business with regards to the environment.
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> Almost all of our fish is hook & line caught with rod & reel-not long lines. In addition to indisputably causing the least environmental impact, the quality is impeccable. Notable exceptions are schooling forage fish like Anchovies and Sardines.
<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins>Oysters require no feeding, fertilizing, pesticides, or Organicides and have only one byproduct after filtering Phytoplankton & micro Organisms. That byproduct is mostly Calcium Carbonate which is Shell. Oysters by nature are Bi Valve filter feeders and not only improve the water quality but will continue to grow for as long as 25+ years in some cases. You can plant Oyster Seed, Spat and using various techniques of Aquaculture regenerate Oysters by the Millions with little to no Environmental Impact. i.e. Waste, Pollution, etc. Thus with proper care the practice of Oyster growing can be Sustained indefinitely as long as you are in process of re- seeding on a regular basis.
<br>
        <br>
<b>Would you differentiate between “sustainable” and “green” practices?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> Sustainable - taking from, but limited, so that the product has an opportunity to continue to prosper.
Green - doing things that are good for the environment (recycle, reuse, reduce, etc)
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> Yes. "Green" to me, is a word that is used to describe a very broad and general area, whereas "Sustainable" has a clearer meaning.
<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins>Sustainable being focused on continual usage of a resource without exhausting it. Green being Environmentally conscious in specific regard to Atmosphere, Pollution, Global Health.
<br>
        <br>
<b>What are the demographics of people you encounter through this work (age, income, race, etc..)?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> N/A
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> I encounter people of all different ages, backgrounds, financial means and just about any other demographic. We serve about 1000 customers per day who represent a large swath humanity-us being located in downtown San Francisco.
<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins>All walks of Life from every corner of this Planet.
<br>
        <br>
<b>What has been your experience in regards to the trends of fish consumption? (spikes in consumption? gradual increase in consumption? drops during recession?)</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> Here in Napa, we have finally plateaued after the past 4 years of a steady increase in business.
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> In San Francisco, my experience is that fresh, high quality, sustainably-sourced seafood is always in high demand.
<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins>We have been fortunate enough to have the problem of Demand always being Greater than our production capability. Sustainable Farming is not about Mass production. It is about Quality over Quantity. At the Farm there is a peak Tourist Season for sure but we get visitors year round. Rain or Shine. The Oysters don't mind.
<br>
        <br>
<b>If you have any experience, what have you noticed regarding number trends of vegetarians, vegans, and pescatarians (those who abstain from eating all meat and animal flesh with the exception of fish)?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> There definitely has been a growth in the vegetarian movement and also in the less starch more protein diets.
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> It has consistently been about 5% of diners I encounter (which is a small percentage of the whole, as I work in the kitchen most of the time).
-	Generally people who are conscious about what they eat will take the time to learn about Oysters and the benefits of Farming them as a sustainable food source.
<br>
        <br>
<b>What is your knowledge of the environmental impacts of land meat production and consumption compared to fish production and consumption?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> Not much knowledge.
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> Both can be environmentally consuming, devastating, or well-managed and beneficial.
<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins>I am no scientist but I understand the impact of Meat Production on the environment from the Clear cut grazing lands to the antibiotic infused feed. Farmed Fish are not always the best conditions depending on the methods used. But to be honest I love a good tri-tip. Finding a grass feed free range Meat source is a consumer choice. Or buying Locally sourced season fish instead of something frozen and shipped in to the local chain grocery store.
<br>
        <br>
<b>Do you believe eating more fish could help alleviate these problems? How or how not?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> N/A
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> Eating more fish indiscriminately will do more harm than good on our waters. Eating the right fish will have less impact but I'm not sure there is a method of harvesting or production that would improve the current state. If we ceased certain practices, it could be improved, but that is subtraction not addition.
<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins>If your purpose is to find more humane or responsibly raised food then it would be of benefit to visit local farms and talk with farmers.
<br>
        <br>
<b>Do you know what aquaculture is?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> The farming of fish, shellfish and marine organisms (fresh water too).
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> Yes.
<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins>Yes.
<br>
        <br>
<b>What are your thoughts on aquaculture? Could this help alleviate the land meat problem?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> Maybe, but you would have to change the publics habits and desires.
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> Aquaculture of shellfish can be extremely beneficial for our coastal bays and estuaries. Aquaculture of fin-fish can be somewhat environmentally benign, but it is rare that there is no disequilibrium from fish farming operations.
<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins>Aquaculture is a great resource for localized food production. There are large commercial companies as well as Small companies that Farm the Ocean and Waters for Shellfish and a wide variety of edible sea life. Businesses must be profitable to remain in business. Whether large or small, Farms on Land as well as in an Aquatic (Mari-culture) environment can have varying rates of impact on the Global Environment mostly based on Farming Methods and Practices.
<br>
        <br>
<b>Do you know of any risks due to increased fish consumption?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> I have known some persons that have become allergic to fish due to a build up of toxins in their body.
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> Certain fish contain elevated levels of heavy metals such as mercury and other toxins.
<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins>Mercury, Bacteria, PSP, Vibrio, water borne illness - these are some threats associated with Fish & Shellfish. Careful practices and Farming methods can reduce the risk of illness & death but some people are just allergic to Fish.
<br>
        <br>
<b>What impacts do you see Hog Island Oysters having on fish production?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> We aim to provide a quality product with minimal impact on the environment and looking toward the future to help preserve ecosystems.
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> Hopefully, by sourcing only the most minimally-impactful seafood, we can help create more demand and decrease the pressure on vulnerable species and habitats.
<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins>Production - A leader in Aquaculture/Mari-culture education. We use Sustainable Farming practices to reduce impact on the Environment. We have great Respect for the Ocean, Planet, & People and like to pass that on.
<br>
        <br>
<b>What impacts do you see Hog Island Oysters having on fish consumption?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1:</ins> Because we offer a high quality product, we see more people becoming fans of fish and shellfish, so I'd say we are helping it to grow.
<br><ins>Response 2:</ins> We'd like to help and encourage people to be thoughtful about where their seafood comes from, how it was produced and harvested. In our case, that's a very story.
<br><ins>Interview 3:</ins>Consumption - Positive Impacts on the public understanding the benefit of eating Locally Grown Sustainable Shellfish. A delicious food product that reflects the very natural Merroir of the Bay Area.
