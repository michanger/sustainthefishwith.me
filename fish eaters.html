            <em><small>These interview responses come from UC Berkeley students. These students self identify as pescatarians, meaning they abstain from eating all meat and animal flesh with the exception of fish. While they differ in why they chose to eat this way, their participation is valuable as it allows us insight into fish and meat consumption trends and consumer decision making.</small></em><br>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style=""><span style="">
                        <b>How long have you been a pescatarian?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins> 6 years
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins> I became a vegetarian when I was 16, and then a pescatarian about 2 years later in college when my doctor and I felt I wasn't getting enough protein. So that puts me at about 3-4 years!
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins> three years 
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins> 5 years
<br><ins>Response 5: </ins> 8 years
<br>
<br>
<b>Why did you choose to become pescatarian? Please explain in detail.
(animal rights, health, unsanitary meat production practices etc.) (Example: If your reasoning is to support animal rights, detail how you came to be aware of the issue and why it matters to you.)</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins> meat is really bad for the environment (fossil fuel production, resource use, etc), so I don't like eating it. 
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins> Well I became a pescatarian purely because I wasn't getting enough protein (head aches, fainting spells, etc). But I became a vegetarian because I took a US history class that focused on the development of the food industry for a few weeks. I was shocked and disgusted by what I learned about the crowded and unsanitary conditions that the animals lived in, the lack of appropriate food for the animals, the massive amount of carbon/fossil fuel emissions released in the production and transport of meat, and the detrimental effects of the pesticides and herbicides used in the process on the health of the workers and nearing bodies of water (i.e. the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico). 
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins> health! my body has difficulty breaking down meat and I never liked chicken
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins> Health, animal rights, reducing my carbon footprint.
<br><ins>Response 5: </ins> I went to a farm in New Zealand and got a tour, the farmer kept using the word 'slaughter' and it really got to me. Then when we went to dinner at the farmers house, a giant leg of lamb was put in front of me and I couldn't really deal with that. Since then my motivations have been more about the environment. 
<br><br>
<b>What types of fish do you eat the most and why?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins>Swordfish, Halibut - taste. Try not to eat tuna because of environmental impacts.
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins>I eat fish pretty rarely, and mostly when I'm eating out (i.e. fish or shrimp tacos, or a salmon dish). Every once in a while I'll buy salmon or mahi mahi burgers to make at home. 
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins>salmon or red tuna
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins>Salmon because it is the easiest/cheapest to cook and red tuna because I love sushi.
<br><ins>Response 5: </ins>Local tropical fish such as Mahi mahi, grouper, snapper, tuna, wahoo etc. because they are local from where I grew up, fresh, supports the local community and convenient.
<br><ins>Response 6: </ins>Mainly salmon because it can be farm raised or free, I also eat a lot of white fish or talapia. Honestly because it's most readily avaliable and that's what my mom gets me. But also because you can either get it free or farm raised. 
<br><br>
<b>Is there any occasion you will eat land meat? If so, when and why?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins>No.
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins>When I'm pregnant in order to offer my child all of the nutrients it could need.
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins>no
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins>Yes, some chicken. For convenience. 
<br><ins>Response 5: </ins>I got dysentery and lost a lot of weight so my mom made me eat chicken for a brief period of time to re-gain the weight and strength but other than that, no. 
<br><br>
<b>Do you know of any health risks associated with increased fish consumption?<br>
Do you know of any health benefits associated with increased fish consumption?
-	Risks: bioaccumulation of harmful metals in fat tissues
Benefits: lean source of protein, omega 3 fatty acid source</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins>Yes I've heard that fish consumption in excess can be detrimental to your health but I don't believe that I consume it nearly often enough to be at risk for such health concerns. However I do know I receive the benefits of iron and protein, and that eating seafood is associated with a lower incidence of bipolar disorder!
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins>I know that if I eat too much I will get mercury poisoning and I know that it has omega3 which is good for me!
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins>Risks: Mercury poisoning/ciguatera in tropical reef fish. Benefits: high protein, low fat. I typically do not eat farmed fish so no added chemicals etc. 
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins>I know the risks of murcury poisining and that's why I don't really eat as much tuna as I would like (and because they're endangered). The benefits are that all the omega 3 oils are good for your brain (i think?)
<br><br>
<b>What is your knowledge of the environmental impacts of land meat production compared to fish production?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins>It is worse due to transportation, raising livestock (water), and greenhouse gases (cows and methane)
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins>I am aware of environmental impacts of fish production, but I believe these are less than those of meat production, and again I only eat fish because I feel sometimes that I must. 
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins>slim
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins>Land animals production causes more CO2 emissions than fish and also the land animal production is inhumane and has many added hormones etc. Farmed fish production has some negatives such as concentration of waste and overfishing is a major problem. 
<br><ins>Response 5: </ins>I know that there are problems associated with overfishing and farm raised fish but I think that there is no comparison to the effects of land meat production...all the food that is needed to feed them and the effects of growing that as well as all the waste they produce and the effects of that run off into the water. 
<br><br>
<b>Do you believe eating more fish could help alleviate these problems? How or how not?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins>Yes, but only if it is local (to reduce transportation costs to the environment) and sustainable (no overfishing!)
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins>I believe being vegetarian could help alleviate these problems. 
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins>there's also a lot of problems with fish too so it would worsen those problems
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins>I think if fish are caught in a sustainable way it could absolutely alleviate problems. Something must change in order to keep fisheries sustainable, however if that were to happen there would be much less CO2 emissions/hormones/wheat and corn GMO production etc…
<br><ins>Response 5: </ins>Absolutely, because the severity of the effects is much less than with land meat production
<br><br>
<b>Do you look to purchase sustainably sourced fish? Why or why not?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins>Yes. Tragedy of the commons is so frequent with global fisheries. 
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins>Yes of course! That is my favorite thing in the world. 
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins>I try to when i can but it's expensive
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins>Yes! I typically only eat hand line caught local fish. I steer away from long lining and yellowfin tuna and other varieties that I know are threatened. 
<br><ins>Response 5: </ins>I try to! because it's better for the environment
<br><br>
<b>Do you know what aquaculture is? How would you define it? What are your opinions on it?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins>Farming fish. I'm not a big fan of it because it creates a lot of pollutants. 
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins>Farming of fish and other seafood. It's better than open sea fishing because you don't destroy the organisms on the sea floor when scooping up shellfish, or accidentally get the wrong kind of fish in the net, but it also has the same problems as regular farming. 
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins>no clue
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins>Aquaculture is the breeding of fish in open ocean areas (in a net/free etc?). I think if done sustainably, with local fish per each area etc. it could be very sustainable. 
<br><ins>Response 5: </ins>Farm raising fish, I think it has its benefits and its problems but overall I think it's better. 
<br><br>
<b>Would you differentiate between “green” and “sustainable” practices? Explain.</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins>No. Both should be acting in an environmentally way that will maintain our environment for the future generations.
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins>Sustainable just means that we could continue that practice for a long time. Green means that it's better for the environment. I would like to do both. 
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins>Green is the trendy word. Sustainable is the actual process/strategy/execution of it.
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins>Yes, green is good for the environment (low CO2, low waste) while sustainable should also be green but more so should be able to last for a long amount of time without any major repercussions 
<br><ins>Response 5: </ins>Not really sure what either is 
<br><br>
<b>Have you heard of “Vote with Your Fork” initiatives? If so do you find them successful?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins>No
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins>No I haven't. 
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins>Nope
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins>Yes I have and yes I do 
<br><ins>Response 5: </ins>nope
<br><br>
<b>Do you hope to impact the food supply chain with your food consumption choices by being pescatarian?</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins>Yes! 
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins>Yes although I doubt I will. I mostly feel too guilty to eat meat. 
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins>I don't really think about it
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins>Yes
<br><ins>Response 5: </ins>yes, my entire family's consumption of meat decreased substantially when I decided to be pescatarian so I hope that does something
<br><br>
<b>If you do hope to influence an aspect of our food system by being pescatarian, explain how your individual food consumption decisions will make a difference.</b><br>
<ins>Response 1: </ins>I hope that others will join me and we will change consumption practices. I hope to encourage others to think sustainably. 
<br><ins>Response 2: </ins>I doubt they will to be honest. 
<br><ins>Response 3: </ins>n/a
<br><ins>Response 4: </ins>I hope to reduce the consumption of meat individually and also by not eating meat educating the people around me to do the same. 
<br><ins>Response 5: </ins>please see above. also, supply and demand. if the demand is less the supply will decrease accordingly
